## Introduction
Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown great promise in various computer vision tasks. This repository provides an example of using ViT for image retrieval, leveraging the power of transformers to achieve high accuracy and efficiency.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vision-transformers-image-retrieval.git
cd vision-transformers-image-retrieval
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the image retrieval example, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and place the images in the data directory.

Run the main.py script to train the ViT model and perform image retrieval:
python main.py

## Results
The results of the image retrieval task will be saved in the results directory. You can visualize the retrieved images and evaluate the performance of the model.
